- Also, will check to make sure we have all the packages installed

- See ```Script-Example/Cross-Validation_Example.r``` and/or ```Parallel_Computing_Example.html``` for more information about packages to install

### 2. Introduction - short introduction to parallel computing (5-7 mins)

- See ```Presentation-Dzievit.ppt```

### 3. Overview of our pipeline

### 4. Running the pipeline line by line

- See ```Script-Example/Cross-Validation_Example.r```

### 5. Running the pipeline from command line or terminal
